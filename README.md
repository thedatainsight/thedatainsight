## Hi there 👋
# 👋 I’m Sasha Milovanov

I work with data and systems.  
I build platforms, pipelines, and the unseen structures that keep them alive.  
What interests me most is reliability, clarity, and reducing the accidental chaos in technology.

### ⚙️ Tools I Use
- **Data Engineering**: Python, SQL, Spark, Trino, Iceberg, ClickHouse, Kafka, Airflow, Postgres, Tableau / Superset
- **Infrastructure & DevOps**: Kubernetes (Amazon EKS), Terraform, ArgoCD, Jenkins, GitOps, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, AWS ecosystem, Cost Optimization
- **Architecture & Governance**: ETL / ELT Design, Data Modeling, Data Quality & Governance, RBAC
- **AI & LLM Engineering**: Vector Databases, Embeddings, RAG Pipelines

### 📖 Writings
I share notes on [Medium](https://medium.com/@thedatainsight) — about data engineering, infrastructure, and AI.  
Not as lessons to follow, but as experiments worth recording.  

---

### 🧭 Principles
- Build systems that survive without their builders.  
- Prefer the simple to the ornate, the reliable to the clever.  
- Seek clarity in complexity, not to deny it but to shape it.
