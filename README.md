## Hi there 👋
# 👋 I’m Sasha Milovanov

I work with data and systems.  
I build platforms, pipelines, and the unseen structures that keep them alive.  
What interests me most is reliability, clarity, and reducing the accidental chaos in technology.

---

### ⚙️ Tools I Use
- **Data Tools and Technologies**: Spark, Trino, Iceberg, Kafka, Airflow, ClickHouse, Postgres
- **Infra & DevOps**: Kubernetes, Terraform, ArgoCD, GitOps  
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager  
- **AI/LLM**: Vector DBs, embeddings, RAG pipelines

### 🔥 My personal projects
- 🧰 [**Data Forge**](https://github.com/fortiql/data-forge) – a modern data stack playground

### 📖 Writings
I share notes on [Medium](https://medium.com/@thedatainsight) — about data engineering, infrastructure, and AI.  
Not as lessons to follow, but as experiments worth recording.  

---

### 🧭 Principles
- Build systems that survive without their builders.  
- Prefer the simple to the ornate, the reliable to the clever.  
- Seek clarity in complexity, not to deny it but to shape it.
